# To clone a Git repository using Ansible, you can use the git module. 
# Here is an example of how to use the git module to clone a repository.
# In this example, the git module will clone the repository located at https://github.com/user/repo.git 
# to the local directory /path/to/local/repo.
# You can also specify a specific branch or tag to checkout using the version parameter. 
For example:

- name: Clone a specific branch
  git:
    repo: https://github.com/user/repo.git
    dest: /path/to/local/repo
    version: develop
